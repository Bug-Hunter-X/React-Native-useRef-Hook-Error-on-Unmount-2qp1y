This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the ref's callback is executed.  This often happens when navigating away from a screen quickly or if there's a race condition. The typical error message you'll see involves `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'current')`.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This callback might run after the component is unmounted
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      if (myRef.current) {
        myRef.current.focus(); //Error occurs here if the component is unmounted
      }
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <TextInput ref={myRef} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
